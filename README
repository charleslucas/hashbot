Take the config.js.default file and rename it to config.js.  Update the default values to the proper values for your bot.

To figure out your AUTH, USERID and ROOMID, please follow the directions from the Turntable API Wiki:
https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API/wiki/How-to-find-the:-auth,-userid-and-roomid

To figure out the TWITTER* config settings, uhm, I don't remember.  I will try to find the instructions I used originally or just redo the process and write it up.
